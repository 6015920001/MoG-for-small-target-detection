# MoG-for-small-target-detection
This source code is for the infrared small target detection method based on  Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) with Markov random field (MRF) proposed in our paper of PR2018: Chenqiang Gao, Lan Wang, Yongxing Xiao, Qian Zhao,Deyu Meng, â€œInfrared small-dim target detection based on Markov random field guided noise modeling, Pattern Recognition, vol. 76, no. Supplement C, pp. 463-475, 2018/04/01/, 2018.  
Note that this source code does not contain the threhold segmentation module, which can be easily implemented.

## How to use this code?
You just run the the file of *main.m* in matlab. Our matlab version for development is Matlab2018a. 
Some modules are written by C++, and you should recompile them if you run
it with errors, Like as follows:
> mex update_Z.cpp  
> mex reconstructImage.cpp
